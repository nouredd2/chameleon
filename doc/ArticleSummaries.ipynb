    "* Li and Wang modified the quantization table itself, and then inserted hidden bits in the middle frequency coefficients. This gave them 36 coefficients to embed in per block, and thus a good payload. [39]\n",

    "* OutGuess used a pRNG to select DCT coefficients, which thwarts the chi squared test. However, an extended version of the chi squared test may work. [3]\n",
    "* F5 embeds only into non-zero AC DCT coeefficients by decreasing the absolute value of the coefficient by 1. The same bit has to be re-embedded in case the original is 1 or -1. Fridrich et al. came up with a detection method for it. [33]\n",

    "# JSteg and Outguess\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSteg\n",
    "JSteg sequentially replaces the LSB of DCT coefficients. It is detected by the chi-squared test because the embedding reduces the frequency difference between adjacent DCT coefficient values.\n",
    "![JSteg algorithm](JSteg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Chi-squared attack\n",
    "We do not know the cover image, but we know the sum of adjacent DCT coefficients remain invariant (since LSB only switches values with their adjacent pair). This lets us compute an expected distribution that would be generated by a stego image, and compare that to the actual distribution of the image being analyzed, using the chi-squared statistical test. The chi-squared value gives a probability that the analyzed image is a stego image.\n",
    "![Chi squared test](ChiSquared.png)\n",
    "The attack can take a sample of the DCT coefficients, so that it can show exactly which part of the image has been embedded into (and thus how long the secret message is, at least against JSteg). The samples start at the beginning of the image, and each measurement increases the sample size, until the sample size is the entire image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outguess\n",
    "Outguess is an improvement on JSteg that uses a pRNG to select DCT coefficients for embedding at random. It is detected by an extended version of the chi-squared test that is more sensitive to local distortions.\n",
    "![Outguess algorithm](Outguess.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extended chi-squared attack\n",
    "Instead of increasing the sample size with constant position, the extended version uses constant sample size but slides the position across the image's entire range. With a given sample size, we increase the sample position by 1 percent for every chi-squared calculation. Then we take the sum of probability of embedding for all samples, and then compare it to a chosen detection threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "To choose a sample size, we select an expected distribution that should cause a negative test result. Taking the arithmetic mean of two unrelated coefficients (2i-1 and 2i), we can use a binary search to find a sample size that does not show a correlation between the actual distribution and the expected distribution from unrelated coefficients."
