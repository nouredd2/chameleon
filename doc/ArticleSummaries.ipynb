    "## DCT\n",
    "* Li and Wang modified the quantization table itself, and then inserted hidden bits in the middle frequency coefficients. This gave them 36 coefficients to embed in per block, and thus a good payload. [39]\n",
    "![Modified QT](QT.png)\n",
    "* JSteg is easily detected with the chi squared test. [3]\n",
    "* OutGuess used a pRNG to select DCT coefficients, which thwarts the chi squared test. However, an extended version of the chi squared test may work. [3]\n",
    "* F5 embeds only into non-zero AC DCT coeefficients by decreasing the absolute value of the coefficient by 1. The same bit has to be re-embedded in case the original is 1 or -1. Fridrich et al. came up with a detection method for it. [33]\n",
    "* Perturbed Quantization has minimal distortion but low capacity. [51]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adaptive\n",
    "Analyzes statistical global features of the cover image, and tries to embed in noisy areas.\n",
    "* MB1 is model based [58]. Can be broken using first-order statistics [63]. Can also be detected through difference in \"blockiness\" [64]. Enhanced version to avoid blockiness is MB2 [58]. MB2 can still be detected.\n",
    "* Chin-Chen et al. estimate the degree of smoothness between pixels, with high capacity. [65]\n",
    "* A Block Complexity based Data Embedding replaces suitable noisy blocks of pixels with noisy blocks containing data. [66]\n",
    "* Genetic algorithm breaks detection by artificially counterfeiting statistical features. Time complexity may be an issue. [74]\n",
    "* Genetic algorithm that uses +/-1 technique on JPEG. [64]\n",
    "* Kong et al. calculates entropy for each region, which dictates embedding strength of LSB. [76]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Other 2D image\n",
    "* Discrete wavelet transform [55] [57] [67]\n",
    "* Nakamura and Zhao morphing process [79]\n",
    "* Zeki and Azizah intermediate significant bit algorithm [80]\n",
    "\n",
    "* New detection methods utilize neural networks [46] [56]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3D graphics\n",
    "* Chao et al. [77]\n",
    "* Bogomjakov et al. [78]\n",
    "\n",
    "## Video\n",
    "* McKeon used 2D DFT for steganography in movies. [44]\n",
